  <h2>Introduction</h2>

      >Home Assistant Yellow's integrated wireless chip supports Zigbee by default.
      By updating the firmware, the wireless chip can be used in a multiprotocol
      setup supporting Zigbee and Thread at the same time! There are two
      limitations: The two networks have to be on the same channel and share the
      bandwidth. This page explains the background.</span

  </p>
  <h2>About channels</h2>
  <p><span>Both Zigbee and Thread are low-rate wireless personal area networks
    (LR-WPAN, IEEE 802.15.4). The standard specifies 16 channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz
    spectrum (channel number 11-25). The standard supports multiple networks on
    the same channel. Each network is identified by a PAN-ID (personal area network
    identifier).
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    The wireless chip in Home Assistant Yellow supports all 16 channels. However,
    it can only communicate on one single channel at a time. Due to this limitation
    it is crucial that Zigbee and Thread run on the same channel for reliable
    operation!
    
    Thanks to the PAN-ID, the Zigbee and Thread networks are still separated and
    therefore won't interfere with each other.
  </span></p>
  <h2>About bandwidth</h2>
  <p><span>
    IEEE 802.15.4 (so both Zigbee and Thread) support a transfer rate of up to
    250&nbsp;kbit/s. For typical Zigbee and Thread networks this is sufficient.
    However, in the multiprotocol setup Zigbee and Thread networks need to share
    the same channel, and therefor share the 250&nbsp;kbit/s transfer rate. Furthermore,
    if Wi-Fi or other 2.4&nbsp;GHz networks are running in a similar frequency range,
    transfer rate might be further limited.
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    For large networks it is advisable to add a second wireless chip, for example by connecting a Home Assistant SkyConnect. This allows
    to run Zigbee and Thread each on a dedicated wireless chip and on separate
    channels.
