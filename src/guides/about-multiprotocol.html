  <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <span
      >Home Assistant Yellow's integrated Wireless chip supports Zigbee by default.
      By updating the firmware the Wireless chip can be used in a multiprotocol
      setup supporting Zigbee and Thread at the same time! There are two
      limitations: The two networks have to be on the same Channel and share the
      bandwidth. This page explains the background.</span

  </p>
  <h2>About Channels</h2>
  <p><span>Both, Zigbee and Thread are low-rate wireless personal area networks
    (LR-WPAN, IEEE 802.15.4). The standard specifies 16 channels in the 2.4GHz
    spectrum (channel number 11-25). The standard supports multiple network on
    the same channel. Each network is identified by a PAN-ID (personal area network
    identifier).
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    The Wireless chip in Home Assistant Yellow supports all 16 channels. However
    it can only communicate on a single channel at a time. Due to this limitation
    it is crucial that Zigbee and Thread run on the same channel for reliable
    operation!
    
    Thanks to the PAN-ID the Zigbee and Thread networks are still separated and
    therefor won't interfere with each other.
  </span></p>
  <h2>About Bandwidth</h2>
  <p><span>
    IEEE 802.15.4 (so both Zigbee and Thread) support a transfer rate of up to
    250 kbit/s. For typical Zigbee and Thread network this is sufficient.
    However, in the multiprotocol setup Zigbee and Thread networks need to share
    the same channel, and therefor share the 250 kbit/s transfer rate. Furthermore
    if Wi-Fi or other 2.4GHz networks are running in a similar frequency range,
    transfer rate might be further limited.
  </span></p>
  <p><span>
    For large network it is advisable to add a second Wireless chip. This allows
    to run Zigbee and Thread each on a dedicated Wireless chip and on separate
    channels.
